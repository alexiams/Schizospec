Things are different now. I am not living the life I would have lived if I were neurotypical (free of mental illness). That's alright. I'm happy with my life.

Actually? I'm ecstatic. My name is Alexia Walgren. I am strong not because I've survived schizoaffective disorder, but because it is a part of me. Because of my occasional difficulty speaking, I'm learning sign language. Because I cannot work long hours, I have found a job I love.

This disorder has held me back. But not in any way that matters. My poetry is stronger now; I'm not afraid of making mistakes. I am cautious without being cowardly. My art is done entirely in pen so that there is no going back: only improving the work I've done.

I have been granted an opportunity to help a community that I previously knew nothing about: A community that I love.

I want to be honest. It's been scary at times. I've shaken from storms that I used to feel calm through. I've felt watched for hours at a time with nothing to prevent it. I have had lighter symptoms than most in my situation. In my honesty, I will say this: I will do whatever I can to show what schizo spec disorders really are.
